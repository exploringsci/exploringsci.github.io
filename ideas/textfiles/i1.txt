You've heard of blogs. Many people with personal websites have a place where they write about things that interest them, things they learned, ideas they have, activities they did, and more. This section of my website will have some of these ideas. I titled this section "ideas" since that will probably be primarily what I write about. 

I might list some ideas for my YouTube channel, projects I might be working on, or just random things that pop into my mind. Stay tuned!
