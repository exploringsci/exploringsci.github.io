        Why does this site look so ancient?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Two reasons: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Want my site to load quickly. Having less bloaty JS, complex animations, and excessive features means that my site 
            loads pretty quickly! The images are still large and take a bit to load, so I'm working on making some more simple 
            images (probably SVGs or similar) to speed up load times.
        </li>
        <li>
            I don't want the site to look like the generic "flat" design trend that is seen everywhere (though it usually looks fine,
            I want my site to be a bit more interesting)
        </li>
        <li>
            I'm working on a more modern design right now though so look out for that!
        </li>
    </ul>
